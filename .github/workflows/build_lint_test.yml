# A job is a set of steps that execute on the same runner.
# The jobs can be run in parallel or sequentially and can 
# have many steps.
# In this case, I created a single job with many steps
# since the configuration is pretty simple but
# I could have created a different structure using parallel jobs.
# Each job uses an own runner.
jobs:
  # Job name
  suite:
    # OS of the runner
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # A step is an individual task that can run commands in a job
    # and share the same runner.
    # Each step can run a ready-to-use action or a bash command
    steps:
      # Runner meaningful name
      - name: Checkout
        # Ready-to-use action made by GH or third party 
        # companies
        # We can recognize the GH actions from the third party 
        # ones checking the name prefix.
        # `actions/` = GH
        # `something-else/` = third party
        # This is a GH ready-to-use action

      - name: Setup and run Cypress
        # This is a cycpress ready-to-use action
        # that setups the runner installing the 
        # dependencies using NPM and installing Cypress
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v2
        # The action accepts parameters.
        # You should read the documentation before using an action
        # to understand what it does under the hood.
